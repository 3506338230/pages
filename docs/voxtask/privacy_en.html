<h1>VoxTask Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="meta">Last updated: 2025-09-22</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how VoxTask ("the App") handles your information. Please read it carefully before use.</p>
<h2>1. Who we are</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Product name: VoxTask (voice memos to text)</li>
  <li>Contact: <a href="mailto:3506338230@qq.com">3506338230@qq.com</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>2. What we collect and how we use it</h2>
<p>We only process information necessary to provide “speech-to-text” and related features.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Microphone audio (user content)</b>: Captured only when you actively press and hold to record and start transcription. Audio is sent via encrypted connection (TLS/WSS) to a third‑party ASR service (ByteDance ASR) for transcription. The App does not store your audio locally or on our own servers for the long term.</li>
  <li><b>Transcribed text</b>: Stored only on your device (App sandbox) for display and saving as memos; not uploaded to our own servers.</li>
  <li><b>Configs & credentials</b>: Sensitive configs (ASR token, LLM API key) are kept in iOS Keychain and used only to connect to their respective third‑party services; not uploaded to us.</li>
  <li><b>Diagnostics</b>: Used locally for troubleshooting (e.g., error codes, network timeouts). By default no audio content is included; not collected by us remotely.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Third‑party services & sharing</h2>
<p>To enable speech recognition and (optional) text analysis, the App communicates with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ByteDance ASR (<code>openspeech.bytedance.com</code>, WSS) — audio is sent to obtain transcription.</li>
  <li>Optional LLM provider (e.g., GLM‑compatible) — only when you enable “smart analysis/polish”, transcribed text is sent to get suggestions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the above, we do not sell or share your data for advertising purposes.</p>
<h2>4. Security in transit</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All communications with third‑party services use encrypted transport (HTTPS/WSS/TLS).</li>
  <li>We recommend using trusted networks to avoid handshake failures or risks caused by proxies/inspection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Storage & retention</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Audio: not retained locally or on our own servers; sent only for real‑time ASR processing.</li>
  <li>Text: stays on your device until you delete/clear or uninstall the App.</li>
  <li>Credentials: stored in iOS Keychain; you can clear them in Settings (debug builds).</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Your rights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Access, correct, and delete data saved inside the App (e.g., delete tasks/clear credentials).</li>
  <li>Revoke permissions (e.g., disable microphone, clear credentials in Settings).</li>
  <li>Contact us at <a href="mailto:3506338230@qq.com">3506338230@qq.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Children</h2>
<p>The App is not directed to children under 13. If you believe we processed children’s data unknowingly, contact us so we can act promptly.</p>
<h2>8. Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this policy due to feature or regulatory changes. Updates will be posted here and take effect from the “Last updated” date.</p>
